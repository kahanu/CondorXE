CondorXE - A pluggable nTier code-generator built on top of MyGeneration Software.  

This application generates complete nTier code for you, based on your nTier framework structure.  It allows you to implement interfaces and enter the code that will build the application framework as you have designed it.

CondorXE does come with some components that will generate nTier code based on how I like it. (See the GizmoBeach.Components folder for sample working code.)

This project is created in Visual Studio 2008, to be used with MyGeneration Software.  http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com, a free code-generator.

CondorXE is written in C# using Visual Studio 2008.  You can use Visual Studio 2010 or later, but you can't use any .Net Framework later than 3.5.  MyGeneration was built to handle on .Net 3.5 or earlier.

A full tutorial and documentation is coming soon!
